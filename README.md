Experiments described in "Closed-Form Feedback-Free Learning with Forward Projection" are may be re-run running the python script provided in "code_ocean_reproduction/run_experiments.py". Note that, for brevity, this script runs a reduced number of experimental replicates, and examines a subset of methods.

Pre-processed datasets and splits are provided in compressed form at https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/fb7xddyxs4/2
Datasets can be automatically downloaded using the above "run_experiments.py" script, by setting auto_download=True in the first code section.
